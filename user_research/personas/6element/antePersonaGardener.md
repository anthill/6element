**Context**

Jeanne works every morning in the garden since she is retired. Morning is the best moment to take care of her flowers because of the weather but also because she likes to visit her friends, babysit her daughter's child or go shopping. Her husband is not retired yet but she is never bored and always has something to do. She likes her garden to be clean and do not want to store garbages or grass. Her daughter recently discovered 6element and adviced her and show her the website

**Motivation**

She never consults it because she knows how and when her usual RC works.
