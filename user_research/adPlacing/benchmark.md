This website is really well done but maybe over-categorized , there is no possibility to type something. It is interesting in this case because it makes categories closed but it is more complicated in our case because there are much more of them. Moreover an object can be in several categories.

## Conclusion

* Informations must be contained in 1 page
* The less input zone there are, the best it is
* How to classify objects that can be in several categories ? 
* What kind of objects do we consider ? Only wastes ? 
* Do not forget to indicate the state of the object : "It needs to be fixed", "it is totally unavailable", "It's fine"
* Ask where the exchange is better for the person who gives. Multiple choices : Giver's, taker's or somewhere else (point relais ?)
* Indicate a time - limitation : can go to RC after that
