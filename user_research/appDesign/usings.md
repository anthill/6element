### Messy ideas by creating

* I want to give/throw out something
 * Check who want this
 * Post an ad (current or perpetual)
 * Have an alert when somebody looks for something I have
* I want to get something
 * Check who got this
 * Post an ad (current or perpertual)
 * Have an alert when somebody got something I want
* I can indicate personal informations to be faster (city, ...)
* I can chat inside the app
* I can indicate that I gave/get or thrown out my object easily
* Organize garbage collection ? (Later ? )
* I can sort ad depending on:
 * the kind of person (particulier, pro, asso..)
 *I receive an alert if a new product matches with what we want to get (&give?)
* I have a favourite system
* I can search this different kind of pieces which are connected at he same time by typing (Darwin example : "saddle dynamo foot pedal") 
* synchronisation with agenda

## 6element
* I have a favourite RC
 * Can I go now?
 * When should I go?
 
* I have specific trashes to throw out
 * What kind of trash is it (help me to know what is it)?
 * Where can I go? 
  
   *NB: If my trash is peculiar, there is a chance that I lend a truck to transport it and have no choice about when going*
  
* I only can throw my trashes out on *Sunday*
 * Where can I go?
 
* I am a professional and I want to know where is the best place me to go/the most favourable
 * Depending on organisation (price, authorisation, ...) 
 * Depending on kind of trashes
 
* I just want to know in which category is my trash

* It works yet
