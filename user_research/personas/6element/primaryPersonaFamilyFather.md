**Context**

Stéphane and his family use to clean completly the house twice a year : once in March when spring is coming and once in the last week of August just before the children go back to school. They like to do it once at all, all together, so they usually do it on Sunday.
It is the occasion to sort their **clothes** and stuff because his wife hates to keep useless stuff. 
During the rest of the year, if they have **bulkies** to throw out, they store them in the garage or in the garden untill the biannual cleanning because they don't want to go to RC just for one piece.
The biggest part of the work is in the garage which is messy. Indeed, he has to throw out **painting pot, scraps** (*chutes*), and **brocken material**.
He cut the grass every two weeks from march to november but let the cut grass in the garden.

Stéphane has used to go to **the same recycling center** for his moving because it is not far away from the place he works. He does not go there a lot, so he always has to check opening times. He has a card where it is written but he searchs on the internet because it is costless than looking for the card. It is very quick and simple because his recycling center is already load.

He doesn't want to store his trashes too long but the RC is closed on  Sunday and Monday so he decides to go there on Tuesday after work, at 5pm. He can see in the RC's page below opening times that he can be advised about the best moment to go on the RC and see that **5pm is the rush hour unlike 2 pm, which is more calm**. He can go at this time because the office is closed untill 2:30pm.

**Motivation**
* He can have basics informations very simply
* When he search a RC, a map is more relevant than an list
* His working schedule and RC's opening times don't match well so he can't permit him to go to the RC and come back with his trashes
