## " It is very embarrassing to realize once you're in a RC that she can't collect your old WC and you have to come back with it"

**Context**
Edouard and Julia, his wife, just moved in their new house. They can leave inside but there are a lot of work to do inside. They want to change the bathrooms, install a shower, change the toilets, change the stairs and repaint each room. Because they both work, they work it in the evening and week-end. Once the inside will be fine, they will build a patio and a pergola for family meeting. 
Julia's father lend them his van when he has to go in RC and go with him to help him. It happens that the nearest RC can't receive them because they don't reap some kind of trashes. I discovered the app by searching a RC near my new home

**Motivation**
Using 6element, they know which RC can collect their trashes and know by the way when is it open. To be sure, I check if bins are full before going.
